ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
I am interested in untangling the molecular basis of agronomic and adaptive traits using data-driven approaches.

ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
Genomic Prediction (GP)
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
Population Genomics
Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Applications of statistical and machine learning methods
ðŸ§ª Collaboration & Methods
I collaborate with field and laboratory technicians to:

Design and execute experiments
Generate high-quality phenotypic and genotypic datasets
Derive meaningful insights through integrative data analysis
This integrated approach ensures that my research is:

âœ… Comprehensive â€” combining field, lab, and computational data
âœ… Practical â€” grounded in real experimental outcomes
âœ… Innovative â€” leveraging advanced modeling methods
